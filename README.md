Welcome to my most current project, it is a quiz app that is built with react using firebase as it's foundation.

I have created the skeleton that allows the app to now function properly

If I were to add new features it would be easy enough, But for now, the features I have are a complete app
as such, I am leaving this flagged as feature complete and now lacking polish.

LIES!!!

TODO 

[] Cookies, because apparently google uses those.
    [x] Write tests for the cookies page
    [] Write tests for the cookie banner
    [] Create the cookies page
[] Implement a way to edit the quiz (optional, for later potentially - wouldn't work if leaderboards)
