Welcome to my most current project, it is a quiz app that is built with react using firebase as it's foundation.

I have created the skeleton that allows the app to now function properly

If I were to add new features it would be easy enough, But for now, the features I have are a complete app
as such, I am leaving this flagged as feature complete and now lacking polish.

please forgive my lack of destructuring in this project, It hurts my eyes to look at too, might get round to it at some point.


LIES!!!

TODO 
[x] Implement searching the DB
[x] Implement deleteable quizzes
[] Fix the only one search per refresh issue
[] Implement a way to edit the quiz (optional, for later potentially - wouldn't work if leaderboards)
