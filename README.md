### Technologies used

- React
- Typescript
- Firebase

### Process

Whilst coming up with the technical performance of the app (user interactions etc.) I implemented test driven development
using Jest as a test runner with the react-testing-library package, this ensured that all features were working correctly 
before starting on styling.

The design stage was completed in Figma, and then translated into functioning CSS by hand 
(ie. not using Figma's export CSS tool) and was done in a desktop first approach, with responsive design being 
saved for when I had a working desktop design.

### Deployment

I have chosen to opt for a vercel/zeit deployment as my other projects are hosted there and as of yet I have not run into
any stability issues on the platform

#### Thank you for reading
